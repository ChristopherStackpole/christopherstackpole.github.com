        Greetings! Thank you so much for visting my Student Governemnt site! Before I get into the core of what this site is about -- the actual "politics" of the school -- I would like to do a brief introduction of who I am. If you would like to skip past this, feel free to just use the navigation bar on the left side of your screen to go to the "Policies" section!
